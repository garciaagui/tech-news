## Description

**31st project** of the [Trybe][trybe-site-url] Web Development course.

Tech News is a [Python][python-url] project that uses [Beautiful Soup][bs4-url] to perform web scraping on [Trybe's blog][trybe-blog-url] and fetch tech news and articles, storing them in a [MongoDB][mongodb-url] database.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è I wrote tests for the functions implemented by Trybe. These tests can be found in the `tests` subdirectory.

<br/>

## Technologies

The project was developed in [Python][python-url] and tested with [Pytest][pytest-url]. The database used was [MongoDB][mongodb-url] and the connection and interaction to it was established through the [PyMongo][pymongo-url] library. [Flake8][flake8-url] ensured code quality while [Beautiful Soup][bs4-url] performed web scraping.
